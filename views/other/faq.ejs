            Who is this site for?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            The aim is to allow the camping community to share more accurate photos of campsites so that back-country and front-country campers know what they're reserving.

            Are there any rules?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Please don't include photos/videos of others without their permission (or blur them out).</li>
                <li>Do your best to show the campsite in the most useful way (wide angle, no things in the way, etc).</li>
                <li>Please follow all park rules (ex. no park drone shots if drones are not allowed there).</li>
                <li>Not a rule for this website - but help keep our parks clean and untouched for the future generations!</li>

        <div class="faq-question">
            Why can't I find a park?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Only the provincial, territorial and national parks that offer camping are available. You may notice that Quebec (QC) is missing - we aim to add that some time in the future.

        <div class="faq-answer">
            While all photo and video contributions are appreciated, please upload only your best photos and videos. In order to keep this website free for as long as possible, our resources (i.e. funds) are limited to keep things running.

        <div class="faq-question">
            Can't I just see the photos on the Canadian (or provincial/territorial) booking website?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes, but many of those are outdated, pixelated, and don't show the whole picture. The aim is to provide more valueable photos and videos on this site.
